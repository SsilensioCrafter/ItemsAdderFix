ItemsAdderFix is a lightweight hotfix plugin for Paper/Spigot 1.20.1 servers that use [ItemsAdder](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/75974/) together with ProtocolLib. Some vanilla packets still ship entity hover events that use Mojang's legacy UUID representation (an integer array or `{most,least}` object). When ItemsAdder/LoneLibs/Adventure try to deserialize these payloads they expect a string UUID and throw a `JsonSyntaxException`.

This plugin intercepts every outgoing Play packet through ProtocolLib with the lowest priority and normalizes the `hoverEvent` payloads so that entity UUIDs are always strings. This keeps ItemsAdder running without touching your existing configuration.

## Requirements
- Java 17 runtime
- Paper or Spigot 1.20.1
- [ProtocolLib 5.3.0+](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib) (already required by ItemsAdder)

## Building
```bash
mvn package
```
The shaded jar will be produced in `target/ItemsAdderFix.jar` with Gson relocated to `com.ssilensio.itemsadderfix.libs.gson` to avoid dependency clashes.

## Installation
1. Place the generated jar into your server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Ensure ProtocolLib is installed and updated to 5.3.0 or newer.
3. Start or reload the server. The console will confirm that hover event normalization is active.

## Configuration
ItemsAdderFix ships with an expanded configuration file located at `plugins/ItemsAdderFix/config.yml`:

```yaml
# ItemsAdderFix configuration
# This file describes how the plugin processes hover event payloads emitted by vanilla packets.
#
# enabled - Master toggle. When set to false the plugin stops registering any listeners.
# debug - Emits informational log messages when payloads are normalized.
# logging.handled_errors.* - Controls the XML audit log produced inside the plugin data folder.
# normalization.hover_event_uuid.* - Fine-tunes how legacy hover event payloads are converted.
enabled: true
debug: false
logging:
  handled_errors:
    enabled: true
    file: handled-errors.xml
    include_original_payload: true
    include_normalized_payload: true
normalization:
  hover_event_uuid:
    enabled: true
    convert:
      int_array: true
      uuid_object: true
```

- Disable `enabled` to keep the plugin installed without registering any listeners.
- Set `debug` to `true` to see informational messages whenever ItemsAdderFix rewrites a UUID.
- Tweak `logging.handled_errors.*` to choose whether normalization events are persisted to the XML audit log, which fields are captured, and which filename should be used.
- Control what legacy UUID representations are normalized through `normalization.hover_event_uuid.convert`.

When handled error logging is active, normalized payload pairs are appended to the configured XML file so you can audit what the plugin adjusted. Malformed or empty payload data is ignored, ensuring the XML only tracks genuine fixes.

## How it works
- Registers a ProtocolLib listener with `ListenerPriority.LOWEST`, guaranteeing the fix runs before ItemsAdder's own listeners.
- Scans chat components in outgoing packets.
- Rewrites `hoverEvent:show_entity` payloads that carry legacy UUID formats (int arrays or `{most,least}` objects) into standard UUID strings.
- Leaves already valid payloads untouched.

No game mechanics are changedâ€”this plugin simply prevents the `JsonSyntaxException` spam and crashes triggered by malformed hover event data while giving you control over how aggressively it logs and normalizes payloads.
